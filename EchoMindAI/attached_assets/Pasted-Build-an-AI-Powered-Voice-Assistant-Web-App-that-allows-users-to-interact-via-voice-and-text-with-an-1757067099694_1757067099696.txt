Build an AI-Powered Voice Assistant Web App that allows users to interact via voice and text with an AI assistant powered by the ChatGPT API. The assistant should listen to the user’s queries, process them, and respond back in natural voice. Users should also have a personalized dashboard where they can view past conversations, set reminders, manage tasks, and integrate with external APIs (like weather, news, or calendar).

🔑 Core Features

🎙️ Speech-to-Text (using Web Speech API or a library like react-speech-recognition)

🔊 Text-to-Speech for AI responses (using browser SpeechSynthesis API or external TTS APIs)

Smart Integrations 🌍

Weather API → Ask “What’s the weather today?”
